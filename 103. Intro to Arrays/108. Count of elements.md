# Count of elements

## Problem Description
Given an array A of N integers. 
Count the number of elements that have at least 1 elements greater than itself.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105 </br>
1 <= A[i] <= 109

---

### Input Format
First and only argument is an array of integers A.

### Output Format
Return the count of elements.

---

## Example Input
- Input 1:
  A = [3, 1, 2]
- Input 2:
  A = [5, 5, 3]

## Example Output
- Output 1:
  2
- Output 2:
  1

## Example Explanation
- Explanation 1:
    The elements that have at least 1 element greater than itself are 1 and 2
- Explanation 2:
    The elements that have at least 1 element greater than itself is 3

#CODE:

```python
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def count_elt(self, A):
        maxi = max(A)
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if A[i] != maxi:
                count += 1
        return count            

'or'

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def count_elt(self, A):
        maxi = max(A)
        c = A.count(maxi)
        return len(A) - c


solution = Solution()
print(solution.count_elt(A = [3, 1, 2]))
```
