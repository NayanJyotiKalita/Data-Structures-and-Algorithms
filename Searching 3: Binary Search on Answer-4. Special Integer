# Special Integer

Problem Description

Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the maximum value K such that there is no subarray in A of size K with the sum of elements greater than B.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A| <= 100000
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

1 <= B <= 10^9



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.

The second argument given is integer B.



Output Format

Return the maximum value of K (sub array length).



Example Input

Input 1:

A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
B = 10
Input 2:

A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
B = 130


Example Output

Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 3


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

For K = 5, There are subarrays [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] which has a sum > B
For K = 4, There are subarrays [1, 2, 3, 4], [2, 3, 4, 5] which has a sum > B
For K = 3, There is a subarray [3, 4, 5] which has a sum > B
For K = 2, There were no subarray which has a sum > B.
Constraints are satisfied for maximal value of 2.
Explanation 2:

For K = 4, There are subarrays [5, 17, 100, 11] which has a sum > B
For K = 3, There were no subarray which has a sum > B.
Constraints are satisfied for maximal value of 3.
