# Count Pair Difference

## Problem Description
You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B. </br>
Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] - A[j] = B and i ≠ j. </br>
Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 109+7. </br>

### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105 </br>
1 <= A[i] <= 109 </br>
1 <= B <= 109

---

### Input Format
First argument A is an array of integers and second argument B is an integer.

### Output Format
Return an integer.

---

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
A = [3, 5, 1, 2]
B = 4

Input 2:
A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
B = 1
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
1

Output 2:
4
```

## Example Explanation
```
Example 1:
The only pair is (2, 3) which gives difference as 4

Example 2:
The pair which gives difference as 3 are (2, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3) and (4, 3).
