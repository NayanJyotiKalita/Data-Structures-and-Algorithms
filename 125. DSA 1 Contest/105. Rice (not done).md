Find the minimum amount of money required to buy at least A kgs of rice. You can buy any packet any number of times.
Note :- It is guaranteed that the answer lies between the integer range.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A <= 109
1 <= Bi <= 109

Input Format
The first argument contains an integer denoting A.
The second argument contains an integer array denoting B.

Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the minimum amount of money required to buy at least A kgs of rice.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = 12
B = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Input 2:
A = 1
B = [2, 1]

Example Output
Output 1:
2
Output 2:
1

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Buy 1 packet of the 3rd type(4 kgs of rice) with cost 1 and

Explanation 2:
Buy 1 packet of the 2nd type(2kgs of rice) with cost 1.
This is the minimum amount required to buy atleast 1 kg of rice.
