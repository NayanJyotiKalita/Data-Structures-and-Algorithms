## Q. What is the time, space complexity of following code :

```python
a = 0
b = 0
for i in range(N):
  for j in range(N):
    a = a + j
for k in range(N):
  b = b + k
```

## Options:
    1. O(N * N) time, O(1) space
    2. O(N) time, O(N) space
    3. O(N) time, O(1) space
    4. O(N * N) time, O(N) space
    5. O(N * N * N) time, O(1) space
