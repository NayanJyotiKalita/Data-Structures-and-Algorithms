# Merge Sorted Overlapping Intervals

## Problem Description
You are given a collection of intervals A in a 2-D array format, where each interval is represented by a pair of integers `[start, end]`. The intervals are sorted based on their start values. </br>
Your task is to merge all overlapping intervals and return the resulting set of non-overlapping intervals.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= len(A) <= 100000. </br>
1 <= A[i][0] <= A[i][1] <= 100000 </br>
A is sorted based on the start value (A[i][0])

### Input Format
First argument is a list of intervals in 2-Dimentional Array.

### Output Format
Return the sorted list of intervals after merging all the overlapping intervals.

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
[ [1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18] ]

Input 2:
[ [2, 10], [4, 9], [6, 7] ]
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
[ [1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18] ]

Output 2:
[ [2, 10] ]
```

## Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:
Merge intervals [1,3] and [2,6] -> [1,6].
so, the required answer after merging is [1,6],[8,10],[15,18].
No more overlapping intervals present.

Explanation 2:
Merge intervals [2, 10], [4, 9], [6, 7] as [2,10].
Since [4, 9] and [6, 7] is overlapping inside the interval [2, 10].
so, the required answer after merging is [2, 10].

# CODE

```python
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    # @return a list of list of integers
    def merge_interval(self, A):
        c = []
        curr_s = A[0][0]
        curr_e = A[0][1]
        for i in range(1, len(A)):
            if A[i][0] <= curr_e:
                curr_e = max(curr_e, A[i][1])
            else:
                c.append([curr_s,curr_e])
                curr_s = A[i][0]
                curr_e = A[i][1]
        c.append([curr_s,curr_e])
        return c


solution = Solution() 
print(solution.merge_interval( [ A = [1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18] ] ))
