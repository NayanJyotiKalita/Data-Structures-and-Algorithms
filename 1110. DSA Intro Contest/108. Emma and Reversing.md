# Emma and Reversing

## Problem Description
Emma is working on a software that manipulates strings. She wants to write a function that reverses the segment of a string A starting from index 0 and ending at the index of the first occurrence of a given character. </br>
If the given character is not found, the string should remain unchanged. </br>
For example, if the string is "hello world" and the given character is "o", then the function should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 4 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "olleh world". </br>
Write a function to help Emma accomplish this task.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= A.length <= 105 </br>
A[i] contains lowercase English alphabets.

---

### Input Format
First argument is a string containing only lowercase alphabets. Second argument is a string of size 1 containing the character.

### Output Format
Return a string denoting the string after performing the reverse operation.

---

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
A = "hello world"
B = "o"

Input 2:
A = "coding is love"
B = "l"
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
"olleh world"

Output 2:
"l si gniodcove"
```

## Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1: -
The first occurence of 'o' is on index = 4(0 based indexing) so reversing the string from index 0 to 4 = "olleh world".

Explanation 2: -
The first occurence of 'l' is on index = 10(0 based indexing) so reversing the string from index 0 to 10 = "l si gniodcove".
```

# CODE

```python
 class Solution:
    # @param A : string
    # @param B : string
    # @return a strings
    def reversing(self, A, B):
        a = list(A)
        idx = -1
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if A[i] == B:
                idx = i
                break
        if idx == -1:
            return A
            
        b = a[idx::-1]
        c = a[idx+1::]
        return "".join(b) + "".join(c) 


solution = Solution()
print(solution.reversing( A = "hello world", B = "o" ))
```
