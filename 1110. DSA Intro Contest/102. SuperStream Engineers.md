# SuperStream Engineers

## Problem Description
```
You've just been hired as a network engineer at SuperStream, a leading video streaming service.
One of your first tasks is to optimize the number of video data packets sent to users based on their internet connectivity.
When a user hits "play," video data is transmitted in packets. If their device acknowledges these packets quickly, it means they
have a strong connection and can receive more packets simultaneously for smoother streaming.
If acknowledgments lag, fewer packets should be sent to prevent buffering.

Given an array A, where each entry represents the acknowledgment time (in milliseconds) for individual packets,
and two integers B and C, can you determine if there's a continuous sequence of B packets with an average acknowledgment
time less than or equal to C milliseconds? If so, it's a green signal (integer 1) to send more packets. Otherwise, it's
time to throttle back (integer 0).

Note: For average, take the floor of (sum/total number of elements).

### Problem Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
1 <= B <= N
1 <= C <= 109
```

---

### Input Format
First argument A is an array of integers. </br>
The remaining arguments B and C are integers

### Output Format
Return 1 if such a subarray exist and 0 otherwise

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
A = [30, 25, 40, 35, 20, 45, 50, 55, 22, 18, 15], 
B = 3, 
C = 30

Input 2:

A = [4, 2, 2, 5, 1]
B = 4
C = 1
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
1

Output 2:
0
```

## Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:
Average of [30, 25, 40] = 31.67 milliseconds
Average of [25, 40, 35] = 33.33 milliseconds
Average of [40, 35, 20] = 31.67 milliseconds
Average of [35, 20, 45] = 33.33 milliseconds
Average of [20, 45, 50] = 38.33 milliseconds
Average of [45, 50, 55] = 50 milliseconds
Average of [50, 55, 22] = 42.33 milliseconds
Average of [55, 22, 18] = 31.67 milliseconds
Average of [22, 18, 15] = 18.33 milliseconds

From the data, we see that the sequence [22, 18, 15] has an average acknowledgment time of 18.33 milliseconds, 
which is less than C = 30 milliseconds. Thus, Jake's device meets the criteria, and SuperStreams server can ramp 
up the data packets to Jake's device for an enhanced streaming experience. Hence the answer is 1.

Explanation 2:
There are no such subarray.

# CODE

```python
 class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @param C : integer
    # @return an integer
    def SuperStream_engineers(self, A, B, C):
        summ = 0
        for i in range(B):
            summ += A[i]
        if summ//B <= C:
            return 1
        i = 1
        j = B
        n = len(A)
        while j < n:
            summ = summ - A[i-1] + A[B+i-1]
            if summ//B <= C:
                return 1
            i += 1
            j += 1
        return 0 


solution = Solution()
print(solution.SuperStream_engineers( A = [30, 25, 40, 35, 20, 45, 50, 55, 22, 18, 15], B = 3, C = 30 ))
