# Range divisibility

## Problem Description
Samantha is a teacher who is teaching a group of students about divisibility by 7. To make the lesson more interesting, she gives them an array A of size N and asks them Q queries given by B </br>

In each query, she gives them a range from L to R given by B[i][0] and B[i][1] and asks them to find the count of numbers divisible by 7 in subarray A[L], A[L+1], ... A[R]. Since some students are struggling to solve the problem, Samantha asks for your help to come up with a solution.

### Problem Constraints
    1 <= N <= 105
    1 <= Q <= 105
    1 <= A[i] <= 109
    0 <= B[i][0], B[i][1] < N

---

### Input Format
First argument A is an integer array. </br>
Second argument B is a 2D integer array.

### Output Format
Return an integer array where ith index contains the count of numbers divisible by 7 in the range A[B[i][0]] to A[B[i][1]].

---

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
A = [2, 7, 14, 5, 7]
B = [[0, 2], [2, 4]]

Input 2:
A = [7, 14, 2, 14]
B = [[1, 2], [0, 3]]
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
[2, 2]

Output 2:
[1, 3]
```

## Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:
The subarray for the first query is [2, 7, 14]. The numbers divisible by 7 are 7 and 14.
The subarray for the second query is [14, 5, 7]. The numbers divisible by 7 are 14 and 7.

Explanation 2:
The subarray for the first query is [14, 2]. The number divisible by 7 is 14.
The subarray for the second query is [7, 14, 2, 14]. The numbers divisible by 7 are 7, 14 and 14.
