# Positive in Range

## Problem Description
You are working on a project to analyze profit for a given set of days. You have been given an array A with profit for N days. You also have Q queries represented by a 2D array B of size Qx2. Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1]. </br>
For every query, your task is to find the count of non-negative profit in the range from A[B[i][0]] to A[B[i][1]].

### Problem Constraints
```
|A| = N
|B| = Q
1 <= N, Q <= 105
-109 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= B[i][0] <= B[i][1] <= N - 1
```

### Input Format
First arguemnt A, is an array </br>
Second argument B, is a matrix

### Output Format
Return an array.

---

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
A = [1, -1, 0]
B = [[0, 2],
    [1, 2]]

Input 2:
A = [-1, -2]
B = [[0, 0],
    [1, 1]]
````

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
[2, 1]

Output 2:
[0, 0]
```

## Example Explanation
```
For Input 1:
Consider 0-based indexing:
Number of non-negative elements from [0, 2] is 2.
Number of non-negative elements from [1, 2] is 1.

For Input 2:
Number of non-negative elements from [0, 0] is 0.
Number of non-negative elements from [1, 1] is 0.
