# Add One to Number

## Problem Description
Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ). </br>

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list. </br>

***NOTE:*** Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which you should practice asking the interviewer. For example: for this problem, the following are some good questions to ask :

Q: Can the input have 0's before the most significant digit. Or, in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input? </br>
A: For the purpose of this question, YES </br>
Q: Can the output have 0's before the most significant digit? Or, in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output? </br>
A: For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= size of the array <= 1000000

---

### Input Format
First argument is an array of digits.

### Output Format
Return the array of digits after adding one.

---

## Example Input
- **Input:** </br>
[1, 2, 3]

## Example Output
- **Output:** </br>
[1, 2, 4]

## Example Explanation
- **Explanation:** </br>
Given vector is [1, 2, 3]. </br>
The returned vector should be [1, 2, 4] as 123 + 1 = 124.

CODE:

```python
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def plusOne(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        carry = 0
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if A[i] == 9:
                A[i] = 0
                carry = 1

            else:
                A[i] += 1
                carry = 0
                break

        if carry == 1:
            A.insert(0,1)
        
        last = -1
        for i in range(n):
            if A[i] > 0:
                break
            last = i
        
        return A[last+1:]
```

'or'

```python
'This works too but is not efficient'
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def plusOne(self, A):
        for i in range(len(A)):
            A[i] = str(A[i])
        b = ''.join(A)
        c = int(b) + 1
        e = str(c)
        d = list(e)
        for i in range(len(d)):
            d[i] = int(d[i])
        return d
```

```python
solution = Solution()
print(solution.plusOne(A = [1, 2, 3]))  -->  O/P: 124
```
