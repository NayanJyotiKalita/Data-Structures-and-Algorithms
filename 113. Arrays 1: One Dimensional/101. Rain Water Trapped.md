# Rain Water Trapped

## Problem Description
Imagine a histogram where the bars' heights are given by the array A. Each bar is of uniform width, which is 1 unit. When it rains, water will accumulate in the valleys between the bars.
Your task is to calculate the total amount of water that can be trapped in these valleys.

Example:
The Array A = [5, 4, 1, 4, 3, 2, 7] is visualized as below. The total amount of rain water trapped in A is 11.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 105 </br>
0 <= A[i] <= 105

---

### Input Format
First and only argument is the Integer Array, A.

### Output Format
Return an Integer, denoting the total amount of water that can be trapped in these valleys

---

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
 A = [0, 1, 0, 2]

Input 2:
A = [1, 2]
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
1

Output 2:
0
```

## Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:
1 unit is trapped on top of the 3rd element.
Rain Water Histogram

Explanation 2:
No water is trapped.

# CODE

```python
class Solution:
	# @param A : tuple of integers
	# @return an integer
	def trap(self, A):
        n = len(A)

        max_left = [0] * n
        max_left[0] = A[0]
        max_right = [0] * n
        max_right[-1] = A[-1]

        for i in range(1, n):
            max_left[i] = max(A[i], max_left[i - 1])
        
        for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
            max_right[i] = max(A[i], max_right[i + 1])

        total = 0
        for i in range(n):
            total += min(max_left[i], max_right[i]) - A[i]
        
        return total

solution = Solution()
print(solution.trap(A = [0, 1, 0, 2]))  -->  O/P: 1
```
