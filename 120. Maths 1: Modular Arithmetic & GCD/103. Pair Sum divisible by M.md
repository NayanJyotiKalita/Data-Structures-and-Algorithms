# Pair Sum divisible by M

## Problem Description
Given an array of integers A and an integer B, find and return the number of pairs in A whose sum is divisible by B. </br>
Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo (109 + 7). </br>

***Note:*** Ensure to handle integer overflow when performing the calculations. </br>


### Problem Constraints
1 <= length of the array <= 100000 </br>
1 <= A[i] <= 109 </br>
1 <= B <= 106

---

### Input Format
The first argument given is the integer array A. </br>
The second argument given is the integer B.

### Output Format
Return the total number of pairs for which the sum is divisible by B modulo (109 + 7).

## Example Input
```
Input 1:
 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 B = 2
 
Input 2:
 A = [5, 17, 100, 11]
 B = 28
```

## Example Output
```
Output 1:
 4
 
Output 2:
 1
```

## Example Explanation
```
Explanation 1:
 All pairs which are divisible by 2 are (1,3), (1,5), (2,4), (3,5). 
 So total 4 pairs.
 
Explanation 2:
 There is only one pair which is divisible by 28 is (17, 11)

# CODE

```python
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def pair_sum(self, A, B):
        n = len(A)
        freq = [0]*B
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            val = A[i] % B
            ptnr = 0

            if val != 0:
                ptnr = B - val
                
            count += freq[ptnr]
            freq[val] += 1

        return count % (10**9 + 7)


solution = Solution()
print(solution.pair_sum(  A = [5, 17, 100, 11], B = 28 ))  -->  O/P: 1
