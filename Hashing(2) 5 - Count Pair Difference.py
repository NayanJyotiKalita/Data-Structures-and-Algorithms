Count Pair Difference

Problem Description
You are given an array A of N integers and an integer B.
Count the number of pairs (i,j) such that A[i] - A[j] = B and i â‰  j.
Since the answer can be very large, return the remainder after dividing the count with 109+7.

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
1 <= B <= 109

Input Format
First argument A is an array of integers and second argument B is an integer.

Output Format
Return an integer.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = [3, 5, 1, 2]
B = 4
Input 2:
A = [1, 2, 1, 2]
B = 1

Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:
4

Example Explanation
Example 1:
The only pair is (2, 3) which gives difference as 4
Example 2:
The pair which gives difference as 3 are (2, 1), (4, 1), (2, 3) and (4, 3). 

CODE:

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def count_pair_diff(self, A, B):
        hm = {}
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if A[i] in hm:
                hm[A[i]] += 1
            else:
                hm[A[i]] = 1
        
        for i in range(len(A)):
            if A[i] - B in hm:
                count += hm[A[i] - B]
            if A[i] + B in hm:
                count += hm[A[i] + B]
        
        return count//2


solution = Solution()
print(solution.count_pair_diff( A = [3, 5, 1, 2], B = 4 ))  -->  O/P: 1
print(solution.count_pair_diff( A = [1, 2, 1, 2], B = 1 ))  -->  O/P: 4
