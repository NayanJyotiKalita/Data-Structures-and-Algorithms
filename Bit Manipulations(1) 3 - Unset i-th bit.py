Unset i-th bit

Problem Description
You are given two integers A and B.
If B-th bit in A is set, make it unset.
If B-th bit in A is unset, leave as it is.
Return the updated A value.
Note:
The bit position is 0-indexed, which means that the least significant bit (LSB) has index 0.

Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 109
0 <= B <= 30

Input Format
First argument A is an integer.
Second argument B is an integer.

Output Format
Return an integer.

Example Input
Input 1:
A = 4
B = 1
Input 2:
A = 5
B = 2

Example Output
Output 1:
4
Output 2:
1

Example Explanation
For Input 1:
Given N = 4 which is 100 in binary. The 1-st bit is already unset
For Input 2:
Given N = 5 which is 101 in binary. We unset the 2-nd bit
It becomes 001 which is 1 in Decimal.

CODE:

class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def unset_ith_bit(self, A, B):
        if A & (1 << B) > 0:
            return A ^ (1 << B)
        else:
            return A


solution = Solution()
print(solution.unset_ith_bit( A = 4, B = 1 ))
