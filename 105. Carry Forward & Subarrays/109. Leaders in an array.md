# Leaders in an array

## Problem Description
Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side. </br>
***NOTE:*** The rightmost element is always a leader.

### Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105 </br>
1 <= A[i] <= 108

---

### Input Format
There is a single input argument which a integer array A

### Output Format
Return an integer array denoting all the leader elements of the array.

---

## Example Input
- Input 1: </br>
 A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2] </br>

- Input 2: </br>
 A = [5, 4]

## Example Output
- Output 1: </br>
[17, 2, 5]

- Output 2: </br>
[5, 4]

## Example Explanation
- Explanation 1: </br>
 Element 17 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it. </br>
 Element 2 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it. </br>
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it. </br>
 So we will return these three elements i.e [17, 2, 5], we can also return [2, 5, 17] or [5, 2, 17] or any other ordering.

- Explanation 2: </br>
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it. </br>
 Element 4 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it. </br>
 So we will return these two elements i.e [5, 4], we can also any other ordering. </br>

CODE:

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @return a list of integers
    def leaders_in_array(self, A):
        c = []
        maxi = A[len(A)-1]
        c. append(maxi)
        for i in range(len(A)-2, -1, -1):
            if A[i] > maxi:
                maxi = A[i]
                c.append(maxi)
        return c


solution = Solution()
print(solution.leaders_in_array(A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]))  -->  O/P: [17, 2, 5]
