# Anti Diagonals

## Problem Description
Give a N * N square matrix A, return an array of its anti-diagonals. Look at the example for more details.

## Problem Constraints
1<= N <= 1000 </br>
1<= A[i][j] <= 1e9

---

### Input Format
Only argument is a 2D array A of size N * N.

### Output Format
Return a 2D integer array of size (2 * N-1) * N, representing the anti-diagonals of input array A. </br>
The vacant spaces in the grid should be assigned to 0.

## Example Input
- **Input 1:** </br>
1 2 3 </br>
4 5 6 </br>
7 8 9

- **Input 2:** </br>
1 2 </br>
3 4

## Example Output
- **Output 1:** </br>
1 0 0 </br>
2 4 0 </br>

## Example Explanation
- **For input 1:** </br>
The first anti diagonal of the matrix is [1 ], the rest spaces shoud be filled with 0 making the row as [1, 0, 0]. </br>
The second anti diagonal of the matrix is [2, 4 ], the rest spaces shoud be filled with 0 making the row as [2, 4, 0]. </br>
The third anti diagonal of the matrix is [3, 5, 7 ], the rest spaces shoud be filled with 0 making the row as [3, 5, 7]. </br>
The fourth anti diagonal of the matrix is [6, 8 ], the rest spaces shoud be filled with 0 making the row as [6, 8, 0]. </br>
The fifth anti diagonal of the matrix is [9 ], the rest spaces shoud be filled with 0 making the row as [9, 0, 0].
  
- **For input 2:** </br>
The first anti diagonal of the matrix is [1 ], the rest spaces shoud be filled with 0 making the row as [1, 0, 0]. </br>
The second anti diagonal of the matrix is [2, 4 ], the rest spaces shoud be filled with 0 making the row as [2, 4, 0]. </br>
The third anti diagonal of the matrix is [3, 0, 0 ], the rest spaces shoud be filled with 0 making the row as [3, 0, 0].
