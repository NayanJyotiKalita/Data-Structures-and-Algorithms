# Row with maximum number of ones

Problem Description
Given a binary sorted matrix A of size N x N. Find the row with the maximum number of 1.

NOTE:
If two rows have the maximum number of 1 then return the row which has a lower index.
Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.
Assume 0-based indexing.
Assume each row to be sorted by values.
Expected time complexity is O(rows + columns).

Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000
0 <= A[i] <= 1

Input Format
The only argument given is the integer matrix A.

Output Format
Return the row with the maximum number of 1.

Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [   [0, 1, 1]
         [0, 0, 1]
         [0, 1, 1]   ]
Input 2:
 A = [   [0, 0, 0, 0]
         [0, 0, 0, 1]
         [0, 0, 1, 1]
         [0, 1, 1, 1]    ]

Example Output
Output 1:
 0
Output 2:
 3

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Row 0 has maximum number of 1s.
Explanation 2:
 Row 3 has maximum number of 1s.

CODE:

class Solution:
    # @param A : list of list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def row_with_max_ones(self, A):
        row = -1
        n = len(A)
        m = len(A[0])
        i, j = 0, m - 1
        while i < n and j >= 0:
            while A[i][j] == 1 and j >= 0:
                j -= 1
                row = i
            i += 1
        return row


solution = Solution()
print(solution.row_with_max_ones(A = [[0, 0, 0, 0],
                                      [0, 0, 0, 1],
                                      [0, 0, 1, 1],
                                      [0, 1, 1, 1]]))  -->  O/P: 3
